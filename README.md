Example of an E-R diagram for a university
Entity Relationship Diagram, also known as ERD, ER Diagram or ER model, is a type of structural diagram for use in database design. An ERD contains different symbols and connectors that visualize two important information: The major entities within the system scope, and the inter-relationships among these entities. <br/>
The components of an ER model are as follows:<br/>
 ## i. Entity/Entities:
 An ERD entity is a definable thing or concept within a system, such as a person/role (e.g. Student), object (e.g. Invoice), concept (e.g. Profile) or event (e.g. Transaction) (note: In ERD, the term "entity" is often used instead of "table", but they are the same). <br/>
 Respresented by Square box.<br/>
 Entities used: University, Faculty, Student, Department, Course
 ## ii. Attributes/Entity-attributes:
 Describes the properties of the entities.<br/>
 Represented by Ovals.<br/>
 Attributes used: Name, ID, Contact, Duration, Salary, Offers
 ## iii. Relationship:
 Relationship describes how entites are associated with each other(if they are).<br/>
 Represented by Decision box/Rhombus.<br/>
 Relationships used: Enrolled, Teaches, Recruits, Contains, Offers, Appointed
 ## iv. Cardinality:
 Cardinality defines the possible number of occurrences in one entity which is associated with the number of occurrences in another. Types:<br/>
      -> One to One <br/>
      -> One to Many<br/>
      -> Many to One<br/>
      -> Many to Many<br/>
